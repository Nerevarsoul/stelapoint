David Gerald Dixon created the scheme through Arboretum Sports (UK) Limited and Arboretum Sports (USA) Incorporated. Through those companies, collectively referred to as \u2018Arboretum Sports\u2019, victims were induced into placing money into what they were told was a no-risk gambling syndicate with the potential for dramatic rates of return. In reality, the scheme was a dishonest vehicle for Mr Dixon to appropriate the funds of its members. Arboretum Sports (UK) Ltd went into liquidation in 2007, and shortly thereafter Mr Dixon fled to Malaysia. He was arrested by the Royal Malaysian Police in September 2014 and extradited to the UK. Mr Dixon was charged with 13 counts of multi-million pound fraud in September 2014. He pleaded guilty to five of the counts on 23 March 2015. He was sentenced to three years and 10 months\u2019 custody on each count, to run concurrently, and has been disqualified from serving as a company director for 10 years.

As a result of the DPA, Standard Bank were ordered to pay financial orders of US$25.2 million and required to pay the Government of Tanzania a further US$7 million in compensation. The bank also agreed to pay the SFO\u2019s reasonable costs of \u00a3330,000 in relation to the investigation and subsequent resolution of the DPA. The suspended charge related to a US$6 million payment by a former sister company of Standard Bank, Stanbic Bank Tanzania, in March 2013 to a local partner in Tanzania, Enterprise Growth Market Advisors (EGMA). The SFO alleged that the payment was intended to induce members of the Government of Tanzania, to show favour to Stanbic Tanzania and Standard Bank\u2019s proposal for a US$600 million private placement to be carried out on behalf of the Government of Tanzania. The placement generated transaction fees of US$8.4 million, shared by Stanbic Tanzania and Standard Bank. Standard Bank agreed to continue to cooperate fully with the SFO and to be subject to an independent review of its existing anti-bribery and corruption controls, policies and procedures regarding compliance with the Bribery Act 2010 and other applicable anti-corruption laws. It is required to implement recommendations of the independent reviewer (Price Waterhouse Coopers LLP).

The sites are known as East Pit, Nant Helen (Nant Gyrlais), Selar and Margam (Park Slip and Kenfig). The sites were operated by Celtic Energy Limited of Caerphilly. The alleged conspiracy involved the establishment of companies in the British Virgin Islands in the ultimate beneficial ownership of Eric Evans and David Alan Whiteley and that the freehold title in the four sites was intended to transfer from Celtic Energy to the BVI companies, thus releasing provisions made in Celtic Energy\u2019s annual accounts in respect of financial liability to restore the sites and that this was done for the benefit of the conspirators. Mr Justice Hickinbottom dismissed the charges in February 2014 after successful applications by the defendants, who argued that the Public Authorities and the Coal Authority have no duties, rights, or obligations that are capable of being prejudiced by the scheme operated by the defendants. The SFO applied to the High Court for a voluntary bill of indictment which was refused by Lord Justice Fulford on the basis that neither the interests of justice nor the exceptional circumstances tests were made out. This brought the prosecution to an end."

Atmomartoyo, a former director of state-owned petroleum refinery Pertamina \u00a0was found guilty of receiving bribes from PT Soegih Interjaya, which acted for Innospec. The bribes were intended to secure, or serve as rewards for having secured, contracts from the Government of Indonesia for the supply of Innospec products. It was found that Atmomartoyo received $190,000 in bribes as well as hospitality benefits whilst on a visit to London. Earlier this year, Willy Sebastien Lim, the former owner of PT Soegih Interjaya \u00a0who was accused of paying Atmomartoyo the bribes, was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison and fined 50 million Indonesian Rupiah. The SFO worked closely with Indonesia\u2019s Corruption Eradication Commission, as well as authorities in the US, Singapore and Switzerland, as part of its own investigation into Innospec, which resulted in the conviction and\u00a0sentencing of the company itself as well as four of its former employees. The SFO also provided assistance to the Indonesia authorities in their investigations, including making available the witness evidence of a co-operating offender.

The Xclusive companies collapsed in August 2008 leaving more than 10,000 people without tickets and causing substantial losses. Customers were invited online to \u2018buy\u2019 tickets for events using credit or debit cards. The principal company in the group, Xclusive Leisure and Hospitality received payments for Olympics and music festivals tickets to the value of at least \u00a33.7 million. On 8 October 2009, Terence Shepherd, Allan Schaverien, Alan Scott, Cyril Gold, Geert van Meel and Margaret Canty-Shepherd were charged with fraudulent trading, offences contrary to the Fraud Act and money laundering offences. On 10 June 2010, all six defendants pleaded not guilty to all counts. Allan Schaverien changed his plea to guilty on 15 April 2011. The Judge ordered that all not guilty verdicts were to be entered for the Fraud Act offences relating to the unauthorised sale of football tickets on 6 June 2011. As a consequence of this decision, Mr van Meel was no longer on trial. Terence Shepherd and Alan Scott were convicted on 5 July 2011 at Southwark Crown Court. Both were found guilty of a variety of offences for failing to supply tickets to the 2008 Beijing Olympics and summer music events. On 11 July 2011, Terence Shepherd, Alan Scott and Allan Schaverien were sentenced to eight, seven and two years and eight months\u2019 imprisonment respectively.
